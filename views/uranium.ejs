    <h3>Why Invest in Uranium Mining Companies?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Uranium is used in a reactor for electricity generation. Nuclear energy provides approximately 8% of U.S. energy consumption. Many advanced countries have committed to reduce carbon emmissions by replacing their energy sources from fosil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas to renewable energy such as wind and solar. However, wind and solar power is highly intermittent and cannot be a reliable source of energy without the use of electricity storage. Their usage is also limited to specifc geographiogical locations with constant sunshine and wind throughout the year such as California and Texas. They are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions. On the other hand, nuclear energy can be generated all day and does not emit carbon dioxide. In order for the society to achieve their ambitous climate goals, nuclear power is the most realistic alternative to the carbon energy.</p>

    <h3>Supply and Demand fundamentals of Uranium</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, the uranium spot price has declined due to reduction in demand from the shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan and Germnay. The public sentiment to nuclear energy has been very negative for last decade. However, due to severe energy crisis in recent years and urgent response to climate change, many countries started embracing nuclear enerty as a realistic solution to combat global warming. For example, The American Nuclear Infrastructure Act of 2021 was introduced and received bipartisan support to preserve and expand America's nuclear energy sector. There are strong fundamentals to support a higher uranium price in the coming years.</p>

    <p>For most uranium producers, the spot price needs to be somewhere between 60 and 70 US dollars for their sustainable uranium production. However, due to the declining uranium price for the past decade, many uranium mines have been shut down or under care and maintenance. According to World Nuclear Association's uranium supply and demand forecast to 2040, it is expected to see a significant supply-demand gap in the decades to come.

    <p>The current underprice of uranium and its expected increase in supply will make investment in the uranium sector attractive for investors with long-term time horizon.</p>
